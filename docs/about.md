  - Led the Operations and Landing Zone work streams of CRA’s Migration Readiness and Planning (MRP) initiative. Designed and implemented CRA’s Cloud Concept of Operations (ConOps). This included the desired IT Service Management state and support model, operational practices (tools, people, processes), business continuity planning, account level controls, establishing best practices, and monitoring all account activities. Provided Engineering leadership in the execution of 5 cloud migration Proofs of Concept (PoCs) which are representative of the various architecture patterns across CRA’s large and diverse application portfolio (over 600).
  - Led in product evaluations and PoCs to support innovation, options analysis, architecture/design validations and recommendations for the Business of IT Transformation, including the following:
    - Conducted PoCs that represented diverse cross-section of applications and capabilities from CRA’s IT portfolio. Collectively the PoCs enabled testing and validation of fundamental application patterns to inform CRA’s application modernization, cloud operations and cloud migration strategies. The results were leveraged to define how the Agency selects and prioritizes applications for cloud migrations.
    - Established CRA’s flagship Protected B (PB) environment in Azure for an SAP PoC. The environment required an Authority to Operate (ATO) to host large amounts of sensitive data. Collaborated with senior IT engineers and Security resources to establish and execute on CRA’s first cloud platform assessment. Architected a solution to migrate over 12 terabytes of data from SSCs on-premises data centre to Azure cloud. Activities included requirements gathering, technology research, options analysis, architecture, collaboration with SSC and CRA security and final recommendation to move forward with the Azure Databox service.

  - Provided senior technical leadership and decision support for the removal of barriers to operating in the sudden remote-work situation, e.g.: insufficient laptops, mobile phones, and Virtual Private Network (VPN) capacity) at the outset of the pandemic.
    - Established the direction to rapidly implement Microsoft Teams for CRA. This enabled communication and collaboration between CRA employees in a de facto, hybrid Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) environment. Used an innovative and iterative approach, creating over 56,000 cloud native accounts and using personal devices for a successful unclassified rollout in under 2 weeks. This provided business continuity for the agency by providing CRA employees the tools needed to continue to serve Canadians remotely. It alleviated the immediate pressure, giving the agency time to further develop the foundational components required to meet the more stringent Protected B, Medium Integrity, Medium Availability (PBMM) security requirements and subsequently deliver a more secure Microsoft Teams service.
    - Provided authoritative technical design and guidance to architect and implement the deployment of secure laptops, mobile phones, VPN and bandwidth capacity by: gathering situational awareness and presenting an Agency-wide common operating picture, coordinating employee accountability requirements, facilitating inter-agency and intra-agency coordination, and providing financial and administrative guidance and analysis.
  - Led in the creation of CRA’s cloud sandbox service to enable Agency innovation. This enabled IT and business across CRA to explore and test new ideas within Microsoft Azure and AWS clouds in time-limited, non-production cloud environments.
  - Led in the creation of a strategic and innovative Cloud FinOps strategy using Serverless Computing to enable the entire Agency to manage total cost of ownership across Cloud Service Providers. FinOps, short for financial operations, is a management practice that promotes shared responsibility for an organization’s cloud computing infrastructure and costs. The FinOps strategy provided the means for different areas within CRA to see similar patterns and their respective financial costs so that cost optimization and improvements could prevail. It enabled CRA’s cloud procurement team to be alerted when approaching purchase order ceiling thresholds, etc.
  - Provided technical leadership in the establishment of a consolidated identity service for CRA’s cloud platforms and SaaS. As part of CRA’s cloud transformation, levered CRA’s existing Identity and access management (IAM) investments, extended our on-premises identities to Azure Active Directory (AD) using SSC’s DCAM and established Active Directory domain controllers in Cloud Service Providers to enable authentication to IaaS workloads and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for legacy applications unable to migrate to modern authentication services, such as OAUTH ("Open Authorization"), OIDC ("OpenID Connect") and SAML ("Security Assertion Markup Language"). Recommended strategic architecture patterns for other government departments to share knowledge, expedite their implementations and reduce IAM sprawl across the GC.
  - Led in the establishment of cloud connection readiness prior to an interconnection between a departmental cloud environment and GC data centers. Led cloud Readiness Activities including: PBMM cloud account via Cloud Brokering Portal, Cloud Infrastructure ATO, Completed Connection Readiness Package, Business Requirements Document (BRD) and Prioritization Criteria including: alignment with WLM (Workload Migration), GC IT priority (TBS Clarity Score), clarification of requirement, receipt of Cloud Readiness Package, Cloud Pathfinder, and GC EARB endorsement.
  - As a Cloud pathfinder for the GC:
    - Collaborating with the GC Cloud community and Cloud Technical Working Group:
    - Sharing design patterns (e.g.: interim cloud to ground connectivity), lessons learned, advice and guidance to further drive successful cloud adoption across the GC.
    - Conducting options analysis and providing recommendations; presentations to executive management teams for endorsement along with supporting action plans and leadership across multiple teams for successful implementation.
  - Provided technical leadership, advice and guidance to matrixed teams of senior IT, business and executive stakeholders that crossed CRA and GC organizational boundaries, and industry leaders, often taking a SWAT approach in crisis situations. Examples include:
    - IRCC requested assistance from departments to address issues with the Global Case Management System (GCMS) that were inhibiting immigration and passport applications following their move from on-premises data centres to cloud. The CIO appointed me to lead and bring resolution to IRCC’s current incident. Responsibilities included:
      - Conducted a current state assessment, created architectural specifications for missing components, created a strategy to test system changes, determined the root cause of IRCC’s issue (misconfigurations with network load balancers, inefficient authentication, etc.) and recommended action plan for expedient resolution.
      - Presented lessons learned, as a result of IRCC’s incident, to CRA management regarding the importance of documenting current state architecture and design.
    - Appointed by CIO as member of SWAT team to address GC Key and CRA’s credential stuffing attack in summer 2020. SWAT’s mandate was to stop the attack, prevent it from occurring again, identify ways to improve CRA cyber security, such as: implementing Multi Factor Authentication), collaborate with TBS/GC Key stakeholders, and recommend unique ways to identify other users who may be impacted, e.g.: using cloud-based Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) fraud detection services.
  - Collaborated and influenced CRA, TBS and SSC procurement organizations to establish a new contracting model, for obtaining access to Fortigate Firewalls via Pay as You Go through the Cloud Marketplace for both AWS and Azure. Faced with unsuccessful avenues to procure Fortigate licenses, influenced and advocated with TBS for their endorsement of a new FinOps model which enabled the CRA and other departments to implement critical cloud-based firewall services.
