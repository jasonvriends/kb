## Interpretation
---

### What does it mean?

- `Why did the author write this?`

    - During David's life as both a shepherd and a king, he faced many dangers and rebellions. As he grew older, King David probably looked back on his days as a shepherd, remembering how he took care of his sheep and found comfort in his strong faith. This helped him to deal with the numerous threats by finding peace in knowing that God was guiding him like a shepherd, who would help him through difficult situations and provide everything he needed, even when things were uncertain.

- `What is the cultural setting?`

    - In the ancient times, taking care of sheep was a common job, and comparing God to a caring shepherd as described in [John 10:11-14 ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10%3A11-14&version=ESV) made sense to people because it related to their daily experiences of being protected and provided for. Supporting this idea is the statement by Morgan G. Campbell in [Searchlights from the Word](https://www.amazon.ca/Searchlights-Word-G-Campbell-Morgan/dp/1608992918/ref=sr_1_1?crid=NSKZL33X7X1Q&keywords=Searchlights+from+the+Word+%28G.+Campbell+Morgan+Reprint%29&qid=1685237382&sprefix=searchlights+from+the+word+g+campbell+morgan+reprint+%2Caps%2C85&sr=8-1), who explained that in Eastern and Biblical literature, a king is often compared to a shepherd, further emphasizing the cultural significance of this metaphor.

- `What are the main teaching points of this scripture?`

    - ^^Lord as Shepherd^^: [Psalm 23:1-4 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2023%3A1-4&version=ESV#:~:text=Psalm%2023%3A1-4%20English%20Standard%20Version%20The%20Lord%20Is,still%20waters.%5B%20a%5D%203%20He%20restores%20my%20soul.) says "*The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.*"
    
    - ^^God as Host^^: [Psalm 23:5 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+23%3A5&version=ESV) says "*You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.*"

- `What does the author hope this scripture accomplishes?`

    - I believe that David hoped to offer comfort and assurance to individuals enduring difficult circumstances, while also sharing his unwavering conviction and encouraging others to place their trust in God. Additionally, he sought to provide guidance and inspiration for those navigating their own spiritual paths, reminding them to follow God's guidance, rely on His wisdom, and discover renewal and peace in His presence. Lastly, David wanted to celebrate God's character through communal worship, serving as a testament of faith, a reminder of God's faithfulness, and a unifying expression of praise and unwavering trust in Him.

## Application
---

Teachings are specific instructions or commands while principles are general truths that can be derived from the teachings and applied to different situations. For example, the teaching "*Love your neighbor as yourself*" is a specific instruction given by Jesus in [Matthew 22:39 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A39&version=ESV). The principle derived from this teaching is that we should love others as we love ourselves, which can be applied to different situations in our lives. 

### How does it apply to me or us?

- What are the principles of the scripture?

    - ^^Caretaker^^: Christians should emulate God's analogy of a shepherd towards others in need. You can see this in [Philippians 2:4 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A4&version=ESV) "*let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others,*" and [1 Timothy 5:8 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+5%3A8&version=ESV) "*but if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.*" We have a responsibility to look after those around us, particularly fellow believers in Christ, offering guidance, support, and encouragement whenever possible. In addition, we should extend this to the wider society around us, where acting as agents of compassion can make a positive impact and show the light of Christ in our heart.
    
    - ^^Fellowship^^: As God welcomes all to join His table, so should believers seek opportunities to engage in community and build relationships within and outside of faith circles. [Luke 14:12-14 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+14%3A12-14&version=ESV) states "*he said also to the man who had invited him, â€˜When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just'.*"
    
    - ^^Stewardship^^: Just as the shepherd was entrusted by the sheep to ration the food and water, our role as stewards requires the responsible management of earthly possessions entrusted to us. [Colossians 3:23 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A23&version=ESV) describes that "*whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.*" Since God is the source of everything, acknowledging His ownership means using assets wisely and sharing generosity towards those less fortunate. This involves balancing individual needs against responsibilities toward the greater whole.
    
    - ^^Trust^^: God's character as host remains consistent over time. We can rely on His promises for guidance, healing, comfort, and growth. As people created in His divine likeness, Christians should continuously strive to deepen their trust in God's unwavering reliability. Nurturing personal dependence on Him allows space for continued translation into Christlikeness. Trust becomes a lifelong pursuit for those desiring godliness modeled after the One hosting infinite hope for human flourishing.

- `How might those principles apply in your context or in the context of your church?`

    Each of the previously mentioned principles (Caretaker, Fellowship, Stewardship, and Trust) provide a framework for creating a caring and vibrant church community, where individuals actively participate in supporting and uplifting one another, while responsibly managing the resources entrusted to them. While each church will have its specific applications and ways of implementing these principles, let me explain how they apply in the context of my church.

    - ^^Caretaker^^: In our church, we embrace the principle of caretaker by prioritizing pastoral care, providing support, guidance, and counseling to our members in times of need. We believe in the power of volunteering, where individuals actively contribute their time and skills to serve one another and the community. We also recognize the importance of holding each other accountable, rebuking one another with love and humility when we stray from our shared values and beliefs.  Financial support is another aspect of caretaking, as we encourage generous giving to support the ministry and outreach efforts of our church. Furthermore, we strive to address the needs of our building, ensuring its maintenance and upkeep, as well as the needs of our church community and the broader community around us, extending our care and support to those in need (e.g., Pinecrest Foodbank).
    
    - ^^Fellowship^^: In our church, we value fellowship as a cornerstone of our community. We strive to create a sense of belonging among our members and the broader community by fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment. After our services, we gather for tea and coffee, allowing time for informal conversations and building relationships. We also organize Bible and book studies, providing opportunities for individuals to engage in spiritual growth and learning together. Additionally, we hold meetings to discuss the business of the church, encouraging open dialogue and active participation in decision-making processes. Through these fellowship activities, we aim to strengthen bonds, foster unity, and create a supportive network where individuals can grow in their faith journey together.
    
    - ^^Stewardship^^: In our church, we emphasize the principle of stewardship as a holistic approach to responsible resource management. We believe in the responsible use of all resources, including our time, talents, and the environment. By practicing financial stewardship, we aim to reduce ongoing costs, allowing more resources to be available for missions and outreach, enabling us to make a greater impact in our community and beyond. Moreover, we understand that stewardship applies not only to financial matters but also to ensuring the proper teaching of scripture, safeguarding the integrity of our faith and guiding others in their spiritual journey. We are committed to promoting environmental stewardship, embracing sustainable practices, and caring for the Earth as faithful stewards of God's creation (i.e., we recently replaced all our lights with LEDs). Through these efforts, we strive to be responsible caretakers of all the resources entrusted to us, using them wisely and purposefully for the betterment of our church and the world around us.
    
    - ^^Trust^^: Trust is a fundamental principle within our church community. We recognize that trust forms the bedrock of healthy relationships, effective leadership, and a thriving community. We strive to build trust by fostering a culture of reliability, transparency, and integrity. Church leaders and members alike commit to being dependable and trustworthy, consistently following through on our commitments and promises. We value open communication, encouraging dialogue and active listening, which promotes understanding and builds trust among individuals. Trust allows us to feel safe in sharing our joys, struggles, and doubts, knowing that we will be met with empathy, support, and confidentiality. It also enables us to work collaboratively, embracing diverse perspectives and ideas with respect and trust in one another's intentions. By upholding trust as a guiding principle, we create an environment where individuals can flourish spiritually, connect authentically, and collectively contribute to the growth and well-being of our church community. In March of 2023, our Pastor went to be with the Lord. We trust that just like God who led the Israelites like a flock through the wilderness ([Psalm 77:21 ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+77%3A21&version=ESV)), God will give us shepherds after His own heart, who will feed us with knowledge and understanding ([Jeremiah 3:15 ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+3%3A15&version=ESV)). We also know that "*the Lord is our shepherd*" as Psalm 23 reminds us.
