# Bible

The term "Bible" originates from the Greek word "biblia," which translates to "books." The Bible is a compilation of written works that were initially composed on papyrus scrolls or parchment, and later reproduced and circulated on scrolls before eventually being compiled into the form of a book.

## Protestant Bible

The Protestant Bible consists of ^^66 books^^ divided into two main sections: the ^^Old Testament^^, which comprises ^^39 books^^, and the ^^New Testament^^, which consists of ^^27 books^^. These books were originally written in ^^three^^ distinct languages:

- ^^Hebrew^^: makes up the majority of the Old Testament;
- ^^Aramaic^^: a language closely related to Hebrew, used in portions of Daniel and Ezra;
- ^^Greek^^: encompassing the entirety of the New Testament.

The Old Testament is organized in the order of the Hebrew Bible and does not include the Deuterocanonical books.

## Catholic Bible

The Catholic Bible encompasses the same ^^66 books^^ as the Protestant Bible and incorporates an additional collection of books known as the ^^Apocrypha^^ or ^^Deuterocanonical^^ books. These books, which were originally included in the ^^Septuagint^^ (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures), are considered ^^canonical^^ by the Catholic Church. They include Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Baruch, as well as additions to the books of Esther and Daniel. Furthermore, the Catholic Old Testament includes supplementary sections within the books of Esther and Daniel.

## Translations

When the various writings that make up the Bible were first written, they captured exactly what God wanted to say in the languages that 
ordinary people spoke. In other words, the Bible was originally written in a way that made it easy for ordinary people to understand both the ^^words^^ and their deeper ^^meanings^^.

In today's world, reading the Bible requires a different approach compared to the people of ancient times. Although the languages used in the original texts (Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic) may appear somewhat familiar to those who understand them, most of us are unable to fully grasp their meaning today. As English speakers, we rely on translations because that's the language we understand. 

Fortunately, there is a wide array of Bible translations available, which can be categorized into three types. This diversity of translations allows us to gain different perspectives and interpretations, helping us to better understand the teachings and messages within the Bible.

### Word for Word

A word-for-word translation, often known as ^^Formal equivalence^^ or ^^Literal^^ Bible translation, seeks to adhere closely to the wording and grammatical structure of the original text. In this approach, every effort is made to translate each word, phrase, and concept in the original text with an exact match in the target language.

Consider a word-for-word Bible if you:

- Desire a Bible experience that closely resembles the vocabulary and phrasing of its original audiences
- Appreciate majestic language and phrasing
- Have access to helpful study resources like a study Bible or dictionary to assist with unfamiliar terms

The following word-for-word translations offer varying degrees of literalness, providing options for readers who appreciate word-for-word renderings of the original texts.

- [King James Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/king-james-version-kjv-bible) is one of the most well-known and widely used word-for-word translations. Its language and phrasing are considered majestic and have had a significant impact on English literature and culture.

- [New American Standard Bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-American-Standard-Bible-NASB) is known for its strong adherence to a word-for-word translation approach. It strives to maintain the original language structure and word choices while ensuring accuracy and clarity in English.

- [English Standard Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/english-standard-version-esv-bible/) is a popular word-for-word translation that seeks to balance accuracy and readability. It aims to convey the original meaning of the text while using modern English that is easy to understand.

- [New Revised Standard Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Revised-Standard-Version-Updated-Edition-NRSVue-Bible/) aims to provide a highly accurate rendering of the original biblical languages, maintaining a strong adherence to the wording and structure of the source text. It is widely used in academic and liturgical settings.

### Thought for Thought

A thought-for-thought translation, often known as ^^functional equivalence^^ or ^^dynamic equivalence^^ aims to convey the meaning and ideas of the original text rather than focusing on a literal word-for-word rendition. In this approach, the translator seeks to capture the essence and intent of the source text and express it in a way that is natural and understandable in the target language.

Consider a thought-for-thought translation if you:

- Desire a rendition that emphasizes the overall message and concepts of the original text.
- Value clarity and readability over strict adherence to the exact wording and structure.
- Prefer a translation that is accessible to a wide range of readers, including those with limited knowledge of the source language or cultural context.

These thought-for-thought translations strive to convey the intended meaning and message of the original biblical texts, often employing modern language and idiomatic expressions to help readers better understand and engage with the content.

- [New Living Translation](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Living-Translation-NLT-Bible/) aims to convey the meaning of the original biblical texts in clear and contemporary language. It focuses on making the message accessible and understandable to modern readers.

- [New International Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/new-international-version-niv-bible/) presents the biblical text in a conversational and engaging style, seeking to capture the essence and intention of the original writings.

- [New American Bible Revised Edition](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-American-Bible-Revised-Edition-NABRE-Bible/) prioritizes readability and accessibility. It aims to convey the biblical message in simple and contemporary language, making it suitable for readers of various ages and backgrounds.

### Paraphrase

A paraphrase translation, often known as ^^free^^ focuses on conveying the Bible in a simple, easy-to-understand language without regard to word-for-word or even thought-for-thought expressions of the original languages. The authors often exercise ^^poetic license^^, leaving great room for personal religious ideas.

Consider a paraphrase translation if you:

- Prefer a Bible version that emphasizes clarity and readability over strict adherence to the original language.
- Value the accessibility of the text, particularly for those who may be less familiar with religious or biblical terminology.
- Seek a Bible that communicates the overarching message and principles rather than a precise word-by-word rendering.

The following three paraphrase translations offer different approaches to conveying the thoughts and ideas of the original biblical texts in a more contemporary and accessible manner:

- [The Message](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/Message-MSG-Bible) is a popular paraphrase translation that aims to present the Bible in the language and style of everyday conversation. It seeks to capture the essence and emotions of the biblical texts, making it relatable and understandable to modern readers.

- [The Living Bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/The-Living-Bible-TLB/) focuses on expressing the meaning and concepts of the original text in clear and contemporary language. It strives to make the biblical message accessible to a wide range of readers, including those with limited biblical knowledge.

- [The Good News Translation](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/Good-News-Translation-GNT-Bible) aims to provide a clear and easy-to-understand rendering of the biblical text. It seeks to communicate the central ideas and principles of the original texts using simple and modern language, making it accessible to a broad audience.

## Study

### Reading Plan

A Bible reading plan is a structured guide that helps individuals or groups read and study the Bible systematically over a specific period of time. It provides a suggested schedule of daily readings to cover the entire Bible or specific portions of it within a designated timeframe. Bible reading plans can vary in length, focus, and organization, catering to different needs and interests. They may include a combination of passages from the Old Testament, New Testament, Psalms, Proverbs, or other selected books. These plans are designed to facilitate regular engagement with Scripture, promote understanding, and foster spiritual growth.

#### The M'Cheyne Reading Plan

The M'Cheyne reading system, designed for both personal and family devotions, comprises four distinct readings. Each day involves two passages from the Old Testament, one from the New Testament, and one from either the Psalms or the Gospels. By following this plan, one can complete a full reading of the Old Testament within a year, while the New Testament and Psalms are read twice. You can read the M'Cheyne Reading Plan at the following places:
